# ML Models
The scripts in this folder are to load the pre-trained models for detection and classification. This library is part of the pipeline and is referenced there.

---
## In the directory
- The `.ipynb` notebooks to train the models. 
    -  RF-Classifier can also be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1La6UB301uMwIz73PL8o6GuTMQiZ4_rxw?usp=sharing)
- The script to wrap the models `classifier.py`

## Model setup instructions
1. download the classifier from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-uSBltCPd2rNKreB3oH7lSbX2HXAOjE) and place it in this folder
2. to test the classifiers, run using python `classifier.py`

## Dataset used
The dataset used to train the classifier can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnmDy4zs9PmH-edCxT5BZvGv8F1bRiPQ/view?usp=share_link)

## Authors
- Saiid El Hajj Chehade for the classifier notebook and its wrapper in `classifier.py`
- Adam Hazimeh for the NN-model and its wrapper in  `classifier.py`
